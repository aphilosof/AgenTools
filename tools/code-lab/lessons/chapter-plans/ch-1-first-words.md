# Chapter 1 — Python: First Words

## Overview

Chapter 1 is the student's first real Python-writing experience. Its role in the
course is to give the learner a working notional machine — a mental model of what
Python does with values, names, and expressions — before any control flow is
introduced. The stepper (line-highlight + live variable table) is woven in from
Lesson 1.3 onward, making the internal state of a running program visible from
the start.

By the end of the chapter the learner can write short Python programs that receive
input, do arithmetic, build and format strings, and produce well-labelled output.
They can read a `NameError`, `SyntaxError`, `TypeError`, and `ValueError` and
know which mistake produced it. The through-line is: *a program is a sequence of
instructions that acts on values — every value has a type, and types decide what
you can do.*

Recall from Chapter 0: the ideas of sequence, algorithm exactness, and debugging
as a process. This chapter gives those ideas a syntax.

## Concepts owned (keywords)

- **`print()`** — output; arguments; `sep`; `end`; multi-arg spacing; expressions as args
- **comments** — `#`; purpose; placement; Python ignores them
- **int** — whole numbers; unlimited precision; exact arithmetic
- **float** — decimal numbers; binary rounding (`0.1 + 0.2`); when to use
- **str** — text in quotes; single vs double; immutable row of characters
- **bool** — `True` / `False`; booleans as their own type
- **None** — the "no value" value; its type is `NoneType`; falsy
- **`type()`** — inspect any value's type at runtime
- **type conversion** — `int()`, `float()`, `str()`, `bool()`; each builds a new value
- **truthiness** — which values of each type count as true or false in a condition
- **arithmetic operators** — `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `//`, `%`, `**`; type-dependent meaning of `+` and `*`
- **operator precedence** — PEMDAS / `**` right-to-left; parentheses override
- **variables** — assignment as an instruction that *stores* a value; the name is not the value
- **reassignment** — updating a variable; state changes visible in the stepper
- **naming** — rules (letters, digits, `_`; no leading digit; no keywords); conventions (snake_case)
- **string concatenation** — `+` joins strings; requires both sides to be `str`
- **string indexing & slicing** — `s[0]`, `s[-1]`, `s[1:3]`, `s[:3]`; strings are zero-indexed; slices are new strings
- **`.split()` / `.join()`** — `str.split()` splits on whitespace (or delimiter); `sep.join(list)` assembles; both return new values
- **`.lower()` / `.upper()` / `.strip()`** — case conversion and whitespace trimming; all return new strings; originals unchanged
- **f-strings** — `f"…{expr}…"`; expressions evaluated at runtime; embed any value
- **f-string `:.2f` format spec** — `f"{value:.2f}"` formats a float to exactly 2 decimal places (e.g. `f"{2.5:.2f}"` → `'2.50'`); the only format spec owned in Ch.1; used for money/prices
- **`len()`** — counts characters in a string (or items in a sequence later); returns `int`
- **`round()`** — rounds a float to the nearest integer (or to N decimal places); returns int or float
- **`input()`** — reads a line from the user; always returns `str`; convert before arithmetic

## Concept map & dependencies

Teaching order is HTTLACS-style (values & types before variables; operators before
strings-deep; `input()` last because it pays off type conversion directly):

```
Ch.0 recall: sequence, algorithm exactness, debugging idea
  │
  ▼
1.1 print + comments
  │  (student can now produce output; sets up all future examples)
  ▼
1.2 Values & Types  [stepper introduced for predict-the-output]
  │  int → float → str → bool → None; type(); "7" ≠ 7
  │  type conversion: int(), float(), str(), bool()
  │  truthiness: which values count as true/false
  ▼
1.3 Variables  [stepper shows state table updating]
  │  assignment; reassignment; naming; state model
  │  reuses: values (1.2), print (1.1)
  ▼
1.4 Expressions & Math
  │  operators; int vs float division (/  //  %  **); precedence; parens
  │  reuses: int/float (1.2), variables (1.3)
  ▼
1.5 Strings
  │  concatenation; str * int repetition; indexing; slicing; .split()/.join(); .lower()/.upper()/.strip(); f-strings (incl. :.2f); len(); round(); why mixing fails (TypeError)
  │  reuses: str (1.2), variables (1.3), operators (1.4)
  ▼
1.6 input()
  │  always returns str; convert to compute; EOFError note
  │  reuses: types + conversion (1.2), variables (1.3), math (1.4), f-strings (1.5)
  ▼
1.7 Strand: Turtle & Sound  (application lesson)
  │  one turtle square driven by one variable; one 3-note motif controlled by one variable
  │  reuses: all of 1.1–1.6
  ▼
Chapter Challenge → Chapter Quiz (gate)
```

Spiral from Ch.0: "sequence as an idea" → now every line of Python *is* that idea
with syntax. Debugging as an idea → now met as real error classes with real
tracebacks.

## Lessons

### 1.1 — Output and `print`
*Arc role:* Hook lesson — the first line of Python the student writes.
*Concepts:* `print()`, arguments, strings in quotes, comments, multi-arg spacing,
`sep`, `end`, expressions as args, `NameError`, `SyntaxError`.
*Rung(s):* 1 predict → 4 fix → 5 complete → 6 write.
*Strand:* words.

Warm-up: From Ch.0 — "what does a sequence of exact steps look like?" (retrieval,
no code).

Subsections:
- **`print` shows output** — one argument, text needs quotes; quotes not shown.
  Examples: `print("Hello!")` → `print("Code Lab")` → `print("The answer is", 42)`
  (multi-arg). Exercises: predict `print("Code", "Lab")` output; fix
  `print(Hello)` (NameError demo); write two-line greeting from blank editor.
- **Comments** — `#` to end of line; Python skips them. Examples: comment on its own
  line → inline comment → commented-out code. Exercise: read code with comments and
  predict what runs.
- **`sep` and `end`** — changing the separator; suppressing the newline.
  Examples: `print("a", "b", sep="-")` → `print("done", end="!")`. Exercise:
  complete a program that prints three words on one line separated by slashes.

Misconceptions: thinks quotes appear in output; thinks unquoted word is valid text
→ `NameError`; thinks `print` works without parentheses.
Error classes introduced: `NameError`, `SyntaxError`.
Recalls: Ch.0 sequence idea.

---

### 1.2 — Values & Types
*Arc role:* Core concept lesson 1 — the notional machine's atoms. The stepper is
introduced here for predict-the-output exercises.
*Concepts:* int, float, str, bool, None, `type()`, type conversion `int()`/`float()`/
`str()`/`bool()`, truthiness, `TypeError` (mixing types).
*Rung(s):* 1 predict → 4 fix → 5 complete.
*Strand:* numbers.

**Quality bar: this lesson IS the exemplar (`exemplar-w1-values-and-types.md`).
All subsections must match its depth, voice, and exercise style.**

Warm-up: `print("5")` vs `print(5)` — are they the same? (Sets up the lesson's
through-line.)

Subsections:
- **Values and types** — `int` (exact, unlimited); `float` (decimal, `0.1+0.2`
  surprise); `str` (text in quotes); `bool` (`True`/`False`); `None` (no-value
  sentinel, type `NoneType`). `type()` to inspect. Examples: `type(7)` → `type(3.14)`
  → `type("hi")` → `type(True)` → `type(None)`. Exercise: predict `type("7")`;
  fix a call that uses wrong-type arg.
- **`"7"` is not `7`** — the operator's meaning depends on types; `+` adds vs
  concatenates; `*` multiplies vs repeats (`str * int`). `int + float` promotes
  silently; `str + int` → `TypeError`. Examples: `7+7`, `"7"+"7"`, `"ab"*3`,
  `7+3.14`. Stepper: predict the output before running. Exercise: spot-the-error
  in `"Score: " + 5`.
- **Type conversion** — `int()`, `float()`, `str()`, `bool()`; each builds a new
  value; `int("3.5")` is a `ValueError`; `int(3.9)` truncates (not rounds);
  `bool()` truthiness rules (falsy: `0`, `0.0`, `""`, `None`, `False`; truthy:
  everything else). Scope note for students: "For the types we've seen so far, those
  are all the falsy values — collections like lists will add a few more in a later
  chapter." Examples: `int("7")`, `float("3.5")`, `str(42)`, `bool(0)`.
  Exercise: fix `print("Age: " + 25)`; write a program that converts a string to
  float and prints it.

Misconceptions: thinks `"7"` and `7` are equivalent; expects `str + int` to work;
forgets `int("3.5")` fails; thinks `int()` rounds (it truncates).
Error classes: `TypeError`, `ValueError`.
Recalls: `print` (1.1).

---

### 1.3 — Variables
*Arc role:* Core concept lesson 2 — state and the notional machine made visible via
the stepper.
*Concepts:* assignment as a store-instruction (not equality), reassignment, naming
rules (letters/digits/`_`, no leading digit, no keyword), snake_case convention,
state table (stepper).
*Rung(s):* 1 predict (stepper: what's in the table after each line?) → 3 modify → 5
complete → 6 write.
*Strand:* numbers.

Warm-up: Retrieval — what type is `3.14`? (From 1.2.)

Subsections:
- **Assignment as an instruction** — `name = value` stores the value under the
  name; `=` is not "equals", it is a copy-and-label operation; the right side is
  evaluated first. Stepper trace is the primary worked example (show variable
  table building line by line). Examples: `x = 5` → `y = x + 1` → `x = x + 1`
  (reassignment). Exercises: predict the final state table; fix `5 = x` (SyntaxError
  demo); complete a short program using two variables.
- **Naming** — rules: starts with letter or `_`, letters/digits/`_` only, no
  reserved words; convention: `snake_case`; meaningful names make code readable.
  Examples: `first_name`, `score2`, `total_price` (valid) vs `2score`, `for`,
  `my-name` (invalid → errors or ambiguity). Exercise: fix three invalid names.
- **Reassignment and state** — a variable holds *one* value at a time; assigning
  again replaces it; earlier value is gone (unless saved elsewhere). Stepper trace
  showing state change. Exercise: write-from-scratch program that starts with a
  number, adds 10, then doubles, printing the value at each step.

Misconceptions: reads `=` as "equals" (comparison); thinks `x + 1` modifies `x`
without re-assigning; thinks names have to be single letters.
Error classes: `SyntaxError` (invalid name like `2score`), `NameError` (using
undefined variable).
Recalls: types (1.2), print (1.1).

---

### 1.4 — Expressions & Math
*Arc role:* Core concept lesson 3 — arithmetic and precedence.
*Concepts:* `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `//`, `%`, `**`; `/` always float; `//` truncates
toward negative infinity; precedence (PEMDAS; `**` right-to-left; parens override);
expressions have a value that can be stored or printed.
*Rung(s):* 1 predict → 3 modify → 5 complete → 6 write.
*Strand:* numbers.

Warm-up: Retrieval — what does `int(7 / 2)` give? (Connects to 1.2's `int()`.)

Subsections:
- **Arithmetic operators** — `+`, `-`, `*`, `/` (always float), `//` (floor, toward
  −∞), `%` (remainder follows `//`), `**` (power; right-to-left). Examples:
  `10 / 3` → `10 // 3` → `10 % 3` → `2 ** 10`. Exercises: predict
  `7 // 2` vs `7 / 2`; debug exercise: run `2^10` and observe the output is `8`
  (not 1024) — explain that `^` is Python's *bitwise XOR* operator, a silent wrong
  answer with no traceback; the correct power operator is `**` (`2**10` → 1024).
  Emphasise: this class of error (wrong answer, no error message) is harder to catch
  than a traceback.
- **Precedence and parentheses** — PEMDAS ordering; `**` before unary minus so
  `-2**2` is `-4`; parens always override. Examples: `2 + 3 * 4` vs `(2 + 3) * 4`;
  `-2 ** 2` vs `(-2) ** 2`. Stepper: predict value before running. Exercise:
  add parens to make a given expression equal a target value.
- **Expressions as values** — an expression is evaluated to a single value; can be
  stored in a variable or passed directly to `print()`. Examples:
  `area = 3.14 * 5 ** 2`, then print it; compute a discount price in one expression.
  Exercise (write, from blank): take three numbers as variables and compute the
  average, printing the result labelled.

Misconceptions: expects `^` to mean power (it is bitwise XOR — silent wrong answer,
no traceback); expects `/` to give an int; thinks `-2**2` is `4`; forgets `**` is
right-to-left.
Error classes: `ZeroDivisionError` (for `//` or `%` by 0; preview only, not
exercised deeply here). Note: `^` does NOT raise `SyntaxError` — it silently
produces the wrong answer, which is a more insidious bug to find.
Recalls: variables (1.3), int/float distinction (1.2), print (1.1).

---

### 1.5 — Strings
*Arc role:* Core concept lesson 4 — text as data; indexing/slicing as navigation;
f-strings as the clean way to build output; `len`/`round` as fundamental built-ins.
*Concepts:* string concatenation (`+`, both sides must be `str`); `str * int`
repetition; indexing (`s[0]`, `s[-1]`); slicing (`s[1:3]`, `s[:3]`, `s[2:]`);
`.split()` / `.join()`; `.lower()` / `.upper()` / `.strip()`; f-strings (`f"…{expr}…"`)
including `:.2f` money formatting; `len()`; `round()`; why `str + int` → `TypeError`.
*Rung(s):* 3 modify → 4 fix → 6 write.
*Strand:* words.

Warm-up: Retrieval — what does `"go" * 3` give? (From 1.2 `*` operator on strings.)

Subsections:
- **Concatenation and repetition** — `+` joins two strings end-to-end; `str * int`
  repeats; both sides of `+` must be strings (`str(n)` first); `str * float` fails
  (TypeError). Examples: `"Hello " + "world"` → `"Code" + "Lab"` →
  `"-" * 20` (divider line) → `"Ha" * 3`. Exercises: predict `"1" + "2"` vs
  `1 + 2`; fix `"Score: " + score` (where `score = 10`); build a banner by
  repeating `"*"`.
- **Indexing and slicing** — strings are zero-indexed rows of characters; `s[0]` is
  the first character; `s[-1]` is the last; `s[start:stop]` extracts characters from
  `start` up to (not including) `stop`; omitting either end uses the string boundary.
  Slices return new strings; the original is unchanged (strings are immutable).
  Examples: `word = "Python"` → `word[0]` → `word[-1]` → `word[0:3]` (`"Pyt"`) →
  `word[3:]` (`"hon"`) → `word[:2]` (`"Py"`). Exercises: predict the slice; debug
  `"Python"[6]` → `IndexError`; write a program that extracts the first and last
  letter of a word variable.
- **`.split()` and `.join()`** — `s.split()` splits on whitespace (returns a list of
  words); `s.split(",")` splits on a delimiter; `sep.join(words)` assembles a list of
  strings into one string using `sep` as glue. Both return new values; neither changes
  the original string. Lists are introduced only as a return-value here — Ch.4 owns
  them fully. Examples: `"hello world".split()` → `["hello", "world"]`;
  `" ".join(["Code", "Lab"])` → `"Code Lab"`. Exercises: split a sentence variable
  and print the result; join a short list of words with a dash.
- **`.lower()`, `.upper()`, `.strip()`** — case conversion and whitespace trimming;
  each returns a *new* string and leaves the original unchanged (strings are
  immutable). `.lower()` converts every letter to lowercase; `.upper()` converts
  to uppercase; `.strip()` removes leading and trailing whitespace (spaces, tabs,
  newlines). These are the three everyday toolkit methods — used whenever user
  input needs to be normalised before comparison or display.
  Examples: `"Hi".lower()` → `"hi"`; `"hello".upper()` → `"HELLO"`;
  `"  x ".strip()` → `"x"`; `"  hello world  ".strip()` → `"hello world"`.
  Exercises: predict `"Code Lab".lower()`; write a one-liner that strips spaces
  from a variable and converts it to uppercase; spot-the-error: student calls
  `.lower()` and prints the original variable expecting it to be changed (method
  returns a new string — must store or use the result).
  Misconception: thinks calling `.strip()` or `.lower()` on a variable modifies
  the variable in place → must assign the result back or use it directly.

- **`len()` and `round()`** — `len(s)` counts the characters in a string and returns
  an `int`; it works on any sequence (more uses arrive in Ch.4). `round(n)` rounds a
  float to the nearest integer (returns `int`); `round(n, d)` rounds to `d` decimal
  places (returns `float`). Note: `round(3.5)` → 4 (round-half-to-even / "banker's
  rounding"); to show the rule clearly, pair with a case that rounds *down*:
  `round(2.5)` → 2. This "optional aside" label keeps it from overwhelming an
  11-year-old, but the paired example prevents the misconception "always rounds up."
  Examples: `len("Python")` → `6`; `round(3.14159, 2)` → `3.14`; `round(7 / 2)` → `4`.
  Exercises: predict `len("Code Lab")`; use `round()` to clean up a division result.

- **f-strings** — prefix `f` before the opening quote; `{expr}` inside is evaluated
  and inserted; cleaner than concatenation + `str()`; any expression valid inside
  the braces at this level (variable, arithmetic, `len()`, `round()`). Ch.1 also
  owns one format spec: `:.2f` for money/prices — `f"{value:.2f}"` always prints
  exactly two decimal places regardless of the raw float. Examples:
  `f"Hello, {name}!"` → `f"The answer is {2 + 3}"` → `f"Length: {len(word)}"` →
  `f"Price: {price:.2f}"` → `f"Total: {total:.2f}"`. Worked example:
  ```python
  price = 2.5
  print(f"Price: {price:.2f}")   # Price: 2.50
  tax = 9.99
  print(f"Tax: {tax:.2f}")       # Tax: 9.99
  ```
  All other format-spec options (e.g. `:<`, `:>`, `:,`) are deferred to Ch.7
  Strings Deep where they get a full concept page.
  Exercise: rewrite a multi-concatenation print as an f-string; write-from-scratch
  a simple receipt that shows item name, price formatted to `:.2f`, and a
  "Thank you" line.
- **String building** (synthesis) — combine indexing, slicing, `.split()`/`.join()`,
  and f-strings to build multi-part outputs; a name-mashup generator (provide values
  as variables — actual `input()` is next lesson). Exercise (write): produce a
  formatted report from three variables, using `len()` and `round()` in the output.

Misconceptions: tries `"Score: " + 5` (TypeError); uses `+` to add string-digits
arithmetically; puts the `f` after the quote; forgets curly braces; thinks `s[1:3]`
includes index 3; thinks slicing modifies the original string; thinks `.lower()` or
`.strip()` modifies the variable in place (must store or use the returned value);
confuses `:.2f` with `round()` — both round to 2 places, but `:.2f` always shows
trailing zeros (e.g. `f"{2.5:.2f}"` → `'2.50'`), while `round(2.5, 2)` → `2.5`.
Error classes: `TypeError` (str + int; `str * float`), `NameError` (undefined var
inside `{}`), `SyntaxError` (malformed f-string), `IndexError` (out-of-range index).
Recalls: str type (1.2), type conversion (1.2), variables (1.3).

---

### 1.6 — `input()`
*Arc role:* Core concept lesson 5 — interactive programs; pays off type conversion.
*Concepts:* `input(prompt)` → `str` (always); trailing newline stripped; convert
with `int()` / `float()` before arithmetic; `EOFError` (brief mention); the
`age = int(input("…"))` pattern.
*Rung(s):* 4 fix → 5 complete → 6 write.
*Strand:* numbers (age-in-days calculator mini-project).

Warm-up: Retrieval — three questions from 1.2 conversion: (1) `int("42")` — what
value? (2) `int("3.5")` — value or error? (3) `int("hello")` — value or error?
The `"3.5"` case (a decimal string) is the most relevant to the mini-project, where
a user might type `"25.5"` for their birth year. Both (2) and (3) are `ValueError`;
the difference is that (2) looks like it should work, which is the trap.

Subsections:
- **`input()` always returns a string** — even when the user types digits; the
  prompt is displayed first (no newline after it); result is the user's line with
  trailing newline stripped. Examples: `name = input("Your name? ")` → print it
  back; `age_str = input("Age? ")` → `print(type(age_str))` (shows `str`).
  Exercise: spot-the-error in `years = input("Years? "); print(years * 365)` — runs
  but gives wrong output (repetition not multiplication); fix it.
- **Convert before you compute** — `int(input(…))` or `float(input(…))` as the
  standard pattern; `ValueError` if the user types non-numeric input (name it,
  demo it, don't handle it yet). Examples: `int(input("Age? "))` → compute `days`;
  `float(input("Price? "))` → compute `total`. Exercise: complete a program that
  reads two numbers and prints their sum (stub: variables named, conversion
  missing).
- **Mini-project: age-in-days calculator** — read name and birth year; compute age
  in years (use a `current_year` variable), then days; print a labelled f-string
  summary. This is a write-from-scratch exercise that integrates 1.1–1.5.

Misconceptions: thinks `input()` can return int if user types digits; tries to
multiply the string result and gets repetition; forgets the prompt argument; wraps
the wrong expression in `int()`.
Error classes: `ValueError` (int("hello")), `TypeError` (arithmetic on unconverted input).
Recalls: type conversion (1.2), variables (1.3), arithmetic (1.4), f-strings (1.5).

---

### 1.7 — Strand: Turtle & Sound
*Arc role:* Strand-application lesson — apply Chapter 1 concepts on two real
creative tasks; the student sees that variables controlling art and music is the
same mechanism as everything else.
*Concepts:* No new language concepts. Application of: variables (1.3), arithmetic
(1.4), `print` / f-string labelling (1.1, 1.5). Turtle API (`forward`, `right`,
`penup`, `pendown`); Sound API (`play`, `sleep`, `note`).
*Rung(s):* 3 modify → 6 write.
*Strand:* core / sound (words for the label output).

Warm-up: Retrieval — what does `90 * 4` equal? (Sets up: four 90° turns = square.)

Subsections:
- **Turtle square from one variable** — `side = 100`; repeat `forward(side)`,
  `right(90)` four times (loops haven't arrived — write the four pairs explicitly;
  this foreshadows Ch.2). Change `side` once to resize the whole square. Examples:
  side=100 → side=50 → side=200. Exercises: modify to draw a larger square; fix a
  square where one turn is wrong (86 instead of 90); write a program that draws
  two squares of different sizes (two `side` variables, no overlap — `penup`/
  `pendown` provided in starter).
- **Three-note motif from one variable** — `root = 60` (MIDI); play `root`,
  `root + 4`, `root + 7` with `sleep(0.5)` between; change `root` to transpose the
  entire chord. Examples: root=60 → root=65 → root=48. Exercises: modify to play a
  minor chord (`+3` instead of `+4`); add a fourth note (`root + 12`); write-from-
  scratch a two-bar motif that uses `root` for bar 1 and `root + 5` for bar 2.

Misconceptions: tries to change the square mid-draw without re-running; thinks
changing `root` mid-playback affects already-scheduled notes; forgets that
`forward` takes one number argument.
Error classes: `TypeError` (non-numeric arg to `forward` or `play`).
Recalls: everything from 1.1–1.6.

---

### Chapter Challenge
*Arc role:* Mixed-concept review; ramps from recall to novel combinations.
*Strand mix:* numbers, words, sound.

6–10 exercises in order easy → hard, scaffolding fading to blank editor:

1. **Predict the output** (rung 1) — five expressions covering `+`/`*` on mixed
   types; student writes predictions before running. Tests types (1.2) and operators (1.4).
2. **Fix the types** (rung 4) — three-line program with two `TypeError`s and one
   `ValueError`; student repairs all three. Tests conversion (1.2) and string ops (1.5).
3. **Name the variables** (rung 4) — working program with names `x`, `y`, `z`;
   rename to meaningful snake_case. Tests naming (1.3); style channel hint.
4. **Stepper trace** (rung 1) — five-line program; student fills in the variable
   table at each step. Tests state/reassignment (1.3) and arithmetic (1.4).
5. **Complete the calculator** (rung 5) — stub with `TODO` for the conversion and
   formula; student fills in. Tests `input()` (1.6) and math (1.4).
6. **Format the report** (rung 5) — given three variables, print a multi-line
   labelled report using f-strings; one line needs a computed expression inside
   the `{}`. Tests f-strings (1.5) and arithmetic (1.4).
7. **Celsius to Fahrenheit** (rung 6, blank) — read temp from `input()`, convert,
   print formatted. Integrates 1.2, 1.3, 1.4, 1.5, 1.6.
8. **Tip calculator** (rung 6, blank) — read bill and tip percent; print amount,
   tip, and total each on their own line with labels, formatted to `:.2f`. Integrates
   all of Ch.1 including `.2f` money formatting (1.5).
9. **Transposing motif** (rung 6, blank, sound strand; requires 1.7) — read a root
   note from `input()`; play a four-note motif offset by `+0`, `+2`, `+4`, `+7`.
   Intentionally placed after 1.7: the sound API pattern (`play`, `sleep`, `note`
   with a variable offset) is introduced in 1.7 and is a prerequisite here. Integrates
   conversion (1.2), variables (1.3), arithmetic (1.4), and sound strand (1.7).

### Chapter Quiz (gate)
*Must pass to unlock Chapter 2.*

Must gate on:
- **types** — given a literal or expression, name its type; identify the odd-one-out
- **truthiness** — which of five values is falsy?
- **type conversion** — predict `int("42")`, `int(3.9)`, `int("3.5")` (error or value?); `int("hello")` (error or value?)
- **operator precedence** — predict the value of one expression with `**`, `*`, `+`
- **`^` vs `**`** — given `2^8`, predict the output and explain why it is not 256
  (checker key: expected output is `10` — binary `0b0010 XOR 0b1000 = 0b1010`; not 256, not 0)
- **variables / state** — trace two lines of reassignment and name the final value
- **string indexing / slicing** — predict `"Python"[0]`, `"Python"[-1]`, `"Python"[1:4]`
- **`.lower()` / `.upper()` / `.strip()`** — predict `"  Hi  ".strip().lower()`; explain why the original variable is unchanged
- **`len()`** — predict `len("Code Lab")`
- **f-string `:.2f`** — predict `f"{2.5:.2f}"` (answer: `'2.50'`); explain why the output differs from `str(round(2.5, 2))`
- **f-strings** — predict the output of an f-string with an arithmetic expression
  inside `{}`
- **`input()` contract** — short-write: why do you need `int()` around `input()`
  before adding a number?

Auto-checked format: predict-the-output (fill-in) for all but the last; short-write
for the final item (graded by keyword matching — must mention "string" or "str" and
"convert" or `int()`).

## Progression / difficulty ramp

- **1.1** — rungs 1–4; boilerplate-heavy; student writes a handful of words.
- **1.2** — rungs 1–4–5; predict exercises with the stepper; first fix exercises.
- **1.3** — rungs 1–3–5–6; stepper trace is the core vehicle; one write-from-scratch
  at the end.
- **1.4** — rungs 1–3–5–6; precedence requires genuine reasoning; final exercise
  is blank editor.
- **1.5** — rungs 3–4–6; `.lower()`/`.upper()`/`.strip()` and `:.2f` added as owned Ch.1 concepts; f-string synthesis exercise is write-from-scratch (receipt with `:.2f`).
- **1.6** — rungs 4–5–6; mini-project is entirely blank editor.
- **1.7** — rungs 3–6; both strand exercises end in blank editor.
- **Challenge** — monotonically blank editor by item 7–9.

Write-from-scratch is the default expectation by Lesson 1.6 for concepts already
learned, matching the rung-ramp schedule (write-by-default arrives at Ch.3 globally,
but each new concept still provides a complete scaffold on first encounter).

## Misconceptions & error classes (chapter-wide)

### Misconceptions
| Misconception | Lesson(s) |
|---|---|
| `"7"` and `7` are the same value | 1.2, 1.5 |
| `=` means "equals" (not assignment) | 1.3 |
| `x + 1` changes `x` without re-assignment | 1.3 |
| `/` returns an integer | 1.4 |
| `^` is the Python power operator (it is bitwise XOR — silent wrong answer) | 1.4 |
| `-2**2` equals `4` | 1.4 |
| `"Score: " + 5` works (str + int) | 1.2, 1.5 |
| `s[1:3]` includes index 3 (stop is exclusive) | 1.5 |
| Slicing modifies the original string (strings are immutable) | 1.5 |
| `.lower()` / `.strip()` modifies the variable in place (must store the returned value) | 1.5 |
| `:.2f` and `round(n, 2)` are identical — `:.2f` always shows trailing zeros | 1.5 |
| `input()` can return a number | 1.6 |
| Multiplying a string reads as arithmetic | 1.6 |
| Quotes appear in `print` output | 1.1 |
| `int()` rounds (it truncates toward zero) | 1.2 |

### Error classes (all registered to Codex)
| Error | First introduced | Triggered by |
|---|---|---|
| `NameError` | 1.1 | Unquoted name as argument; undefined variable |
| `SyntaxError` | 1.1, 1.3 | Missing quotes; `2score`; bad f-string |
| `TypeError` | 1.2 | `str + int`; `str * float`; wrong-type arg to `forward()`/`play()` |
| `ValueError` | 1.2, 1.6 | `int("3.5")`; `int("hello")` |
| `IndexError` | 1.5 | Out-of-range string index (e.g. `"Python"[6]`) |
| `ZeroDivisionError` | 1.4 | `// 0` or `% 0` (introduced but not drilled) |

Note: `^` (bitwise XOR) is **not** a `SyntaxError` — it produces a silent wrong
answer. E.g. `2^10` → `8` (not 1024). Taught in 1.4 as an example of a logic error
with no traceback, which is harder to catch than an exception.
